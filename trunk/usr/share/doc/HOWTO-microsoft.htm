<h1><img style="width: 96px; height: 96px;" src="puppylogo96.png" alt=""> HOWTO: Microsoft
documents</h1>
We know that <i>Microsoft Office</i> is the defacto standard, so it is
something we have to cope with. The most common problem is Word documents --
many business people will type a document using Word and then attach it to an
email and expect the recipients to be able to view it. So, let's consider
Word...<br>


<h2>MS Word .doc files</h2>
Microsoft uses a proprietory and poorly documented format for Word files, and
to make matters worse, a document prepared with Word2000 (say) may not be
viewable by someone with Word97. This puts customers into Microsoft's
infamous upgrade cycle.<br>
<br>
Anyway, let's focus on the situation with Puppy.<p>Puppy has <i>Abiword</i> word processor,
which has <i>wv</i> builtin to it. This allows Abiword to import and export
MS DOC files.<br>
</p>
<p>The Abiword help page: <a href="../../../../../../../../../usr/share/doc/abiword.htm">/usr/share/doc/abiword.htm</a><br>
</p>

<p>Note also that Rox file manager, Sylpheed mail client and other
applications are setup to invoke Abiword. Left-click on a DOC file in Rox,
and it will open in Abiword.</p>

<p>The configuration files for ROX-Filer are in /root/Choices/ <br>
The configuration file for Sylpheed is /root/.sylpheed/sylpheedrc<br>
MIME types and external applications for Sylpheed attachments are obtained
from /etc/mimetypes and /etc/mailcap<br>
Seamonkey also reads /etc/mimetypes and /etc/mailcap, to offer a player/viewer for a file that you are about to download.<br>
</p>

<h2>MS Word .rtf files</h2>
<i>RTF</i> means Rich Text Format, and is a file format for wordprocessors.
The  RTF standard is fully documented and all major word processors can open
and  save in it, including MS Word. Thus, users of MS Word should be
encouraged to save documents in RTF format before sending them off to other
people.<br><p>Abiword can import and export RTF.</p>

<p>Once again, ROX-Filer and Sylpheed have been setup to recognise files with
".rtf" extension. In the case of ROX, just left-click.<br>
</p>

<h2>MS Excel spreadsheet files</h2>

<p>The <i>Excel</i> spreadsheet program is a part of the Office suite.</p>

<p>Puppy up to version 0.9.7 has <i>ABS</i>, which is a spreadsheet
application. ABS is still available as a PET package.
The native file format of ABS can be converted to Excel format, and vice
versa, by means of a macro. The documentation can be found in the external
package.</p>

<p>Puppy version 0.9.8+ has <i>Planmaker Free Edition</i>, which is a
free
release of a Planmaker, a commercial product. The Free Edition is not
crippled and has no restrictions on usage, except that there is a
limitation on maximum number of rows and columns that can be edited.
The really good news is that it
can open, edit and save Excel-format spreadsheet files. Planmaker is still available as a PET package.<br>
</p>

<p>The documentation is a PDF file: <a href="planmaker.pdf">planmaker.pdf</a> (only if Planmaker package installed)<br>
Here is the licence document: <a href="/usr/local/planmaker/license.txt">license.txt</a> (only if Planmaker package installed)<br>
</p>
<p>Puppy version 1.0.4 and later has <span style="font-style: italic;">Gnumeric</span>, with a full set of plugins, including Excel import and export. Gnumeric is open source, free, and is superb.<br>
</p>
<p>Finally, if you want the ultimate, <span style="font-style: italic;">OpenOffice</span>
is available for Puppy, not in the live-CD but available either as a
PET package or an SFS file. The latter is recommended. If you don't
know what a SFS file is, please go to <a href="http://puppylinux.com/development/package-management.htm">http://puppylinux.com/development/package-management.htm</a>.<br>
</p>


<h2>MS Fonts</h2>

<p>Yes, MS TrueType fonts can easily be used in Puppy -- it is just a
matter
of copying them across (or, if that is a legal problem, a symbolic link
can be made from the Puppy partition to the fonts in the Windows
partition).</p>

<p>The Abiword help page explains how: <a href="/usr/share/doc/abiword.htm">/usr/share/doc/abiword.htm</a><br>
</p>
<h2>Open Document Format</h2>
<p>I mention this here as ODF is becoming the international standard
document file format. Abiword can now import and export ODF files.<br>
</p>
<p>Yeah, but what about MS Office? Microsoft has been strongly opposed
to ODF, and still snipe at it. It is in Microsoft's interest <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span>
to have open document standards, as by having closed (secret) file
formats they can always stay a step ahead of the competition. So, MS
does not offer ODF import and export for Office, however the good news
is that a company has developed a plugin that does just that, and it's
free.<br>
</p>
<p>I don't yet have details on where to obtain the ODF plugin for MS Office.<br>
