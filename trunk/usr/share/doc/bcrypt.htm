<A NAME="lbAB">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

bcrypt - blowfish file encryption
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>bcrypt</B> [-orc]<B>[-s</B>N]

<I>file ...</I>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>bcrypt</B>

encrypts and decrypts files using the
<I>blowfish </I>

algorithm.
<P>

Encrypted files will be saved with an extension of
<B>.bfe</B>.

Any files ending in
<B>.bfe</B>

will be assumed to be encrypted with
<B>bcrypt</B> and 

will attempt to decrypt them. Any other input files will be encrypted.
If more than one type of file is given,
<B>bcrypt</B>

will process all files which are the same as the first filetype given.
<P>

By default,
<B>bcrypt</B>

will compress input files before encryption, remove input files after
they are processed (assuming they are processed successfully) and
overwrite input files with random data to prevent data recovery.
<P>

Passphrases may be between 8 and 56 characters. Regardless of the
passphrase size, the key is hashed internally to 448 bits - the
largest keysize supported by the
<I>blowfish</I> algorithm. However, it is still wise to use a strong

passphrase.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-o</B>

<DD>
print output to standard out. Implies -r.
<DT><B>-c</B>

<DD>
DO NOT compress files before encryption.
<DT><B>-r</B>

<DD>
DO NOT remove input files after processing
<DT><B>-s</B><I>N</I>

<DD>
How many times to overwrite input files with random data before deleting. 
The default number of overwrites is 3. Use -s0 to disable this 
feature. No effect if -r is supplied.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

<B>The</B> -o ,<B>-r </B>,and<B> -c </B>options

each have the opposite effects
if the appropriate settings are altered from the defaults in config.h. To
determine what effect each of these have on your system, run
<B>bcrypt</B>

without any options.
<P>

Encrypted files should be compatible between most systems.
Binary compatibility has been tested on all supported systems. There
is a list of supported systems in the README file that was included
with this software.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

Probably.
If you find that it will not compile and run on your system, or that 
encrypted files are not compatible with other platforms, its probably 
because I don't have access to the platform in question. Patches or 
access to an unsupported machine are welcome.
