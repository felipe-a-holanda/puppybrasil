<h2>Downloading Options</h2>
<br>
<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Exit after seeding number of hours:</span><br>
</h4>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p>Indicate how long (in hours) you want to "seed" (continue uploading)
after download has completed. It is considered polite and fair (and
required by some tracker sites) to seed for some time after downloading.</p>
</div>
<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Exit after seeding quotient (UL/DL):</span></h4>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p>Specify a desired "seed ratio". After downloading completes, the
client will continue seeding (uploading) until your total upload volume
divided by your download volume equals this number. Fractional values
(such as 1.5) are allowed. It is considered polite and fair (and
required by some tracker sites) to seed until your ratio is at least
1:1.</p>
</div>
<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Port to listen on:</span></h4>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p>Specify the TCP port number on which to listen for incoming
connections. By default, CTorrent starts at 2706 and searches for an
available port in decreasing order until it finds one or exhausts all
ports down through 2106.</p>
</div>
<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cache size in MegaBytes:</span></h4>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p>Specify the amount of memory to use for caching downloaded slices.
You will probably need to use this option if running on a
memory-constrained system such as a router or SAN device. If you use a
value of 0, no memory cache will be used but the process will be more
disk-intensive. If cache is used, the size will be set to a minimum of
the size of 4 pieces.</p>
</div>
<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Force seed mode (skip hash check at startup) (setup as default when seed button is selected):</span></h4>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p>Perform a fast startup for seeding by skipping the initial hash
verification of the files. Use this option only if you have completed
downloading the entire torrent and are absolutely certain that the
files are intact.</p>
</div>
<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Block size in kilobytes (default 16, max 128):</span></h4>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p>Sets the size of the basic unit of download. For greatest
compatibility with other peer clients, use the default. This value can
also affect the precision with which bandwidth is managed.</p>
</div>
<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">File to download first:</span></h4>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p>Specify a file in the torrent to download as a priority; the file
numbers can be seen with the -n option. Only pieces that are part of
this file will be downloaded until the file is complete. At that point,
the next file will be targeted. When the last (highest-numbered) file
in the torrent is completed, this option is deactivated and the
remaining pieces of the torrent will be downloaded.</p>
</div>
<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Max download rate:</span></h4>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p>Specify a download bandwidth limit for this torrent. The client will
maintain its short-term average download rate at or below this value.</p>
</div>
<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Max upload rate:</span></h4>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p>Specify an upload bandwidth limit for this torrent. The client will
maintain its short-term average upload rate at or below this value.</p>
</div>
<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Disguise ctorrent as another program (Peer ID):</span></h4>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p>Specify an alternate peer ID prefix. This can be useful if a tracker
is set up to only allow client programs that it recognizes. (The admin
may not even realize it, so you may want to try contacting them to
request that they change their configuration or add Enhanced CTorrent
to the list.) If you receive a tracker warning message that your client
is out of date, try using this option with the prefix of another
well-known client program (such as "-AZ2304-").</p>
</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Not implemented yet:</h3>
<br>
<br>
-i ip&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listen for connections on ip. (default all IP's)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p>Specify the IP address on which you want to listen for incoming
connections. This is only useful if your system has multiple network
interfaces and you want to restrict access or run multiple clients on
different interfaces.</p>
</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
-s filename&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Download ("save as") to a different file or directory.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p>Download to a different filename or top-level directory name than what is given in the metainfo file.</p>
</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
-b filename&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bitfield filename. (use it carefully)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p>Save piece completion status to a file on exit, and read this file
on startup. This can be used as a "fast restart" option, but note that
no validation of the initial status is performed. Use this option only
if you are absolutely certain that the files have not been changed or
corrupted since the bitfield file was written.</p>
</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
-M max_peers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Max peers count. (default 100)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p>Set the maximum allowable number of peer connections. If this number
is reached, no new connections will be initiated or accepted. If memory
or upload bandwidth are constrained, you may want to use this option to
specify a lower value.</p>
</div>
<br>
-m min_peers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Min peers count. (default 1)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p>Set the desired minimum number of peer connections. If the number
falls below this value, the client will contact the tracker to request
more peers.</p>
