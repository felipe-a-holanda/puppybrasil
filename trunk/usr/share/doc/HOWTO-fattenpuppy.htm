<h1><img style="width: 96px; height: 96px;" alt="" src="puppylogo96.png">HOWTO fatten Puppy</h1>

<p>Puppy can be easily extended. This page is just getting started.<br>
</p>
<p>Note that some links given here will only exist if the package is
installed.<br>
</p>
<p>Note that it is easy to build a custom Puppy, with the packages you want. The way to do this is to either:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download <a href="http://puppylinux.com/woof/">Woof</a>, which has build scripts to put together a new live-CD with packages of your choice. Or...<br>
  </li>
  <li>Run the "Remaster CD" script, to be found in the menu at "Menu -&gt; Setup -&gt; Remaster Puppy live-CD".<br>

  </li>
</ol>

provided in the 'standard' edition Puppy live-CD, with a selection of extensions and the Macromedia Flash
plugin, also the Gxine media-player plugin, so this is already fattened! However, you should be able to add
Java and expand the streaming audio and video support -- some notes are below...<br>

<h2>Mozilla SeaMonkey</h2>
<h3>Spellchecker</h3>
SeaMonkey Composer (the WYSIWYG HTML editor) has a spellchecker,
but some builds of Puppy are without any dictionaries (or may only have
the US English dictionary). This is very easy to remedy. The website
that has dictionaries for all languages is <a href="http://dictionaries.mozdev.org/installation.html">http://dictionaries.mozdev.org/installation.html</a>,
and you can either use a browser to go straight there, or open the
spellechecker in Composer, by "Edit -&gt; Check spelling..." then click
on&nbsp; "Download more".&nbsp; The instructions on the website state to
left-click to download and install a dictionary, however for me that
gave a download error. Instead, right-click and choose to download and
save the file, for example "spell-en-AU.xpi". Then running Seamonkey,
choose "File -&gt; Open..." and open the ".xpi" file and it will
automatically install.<br>

You can find installed dictionaries in /usr/lib/seamonkey/components/myspell/.<br>
<h3>Themes</h3>

Yeah, you can add themes to Seamonkey. need to write the howto here...<br>
<h3>Flash</h3>
Puppy has the Adobe Flash player plugin, located at
/usr/lib/mozilla/plugins. SeaMonkey, Firefox and Opera are able to find
it at that location.<br>
<br>To install a new Flash plugin, download it from Adobe, expand the file
(just click on it), then copy 'libflashplayer.so' to
/usr/lib/mozilla/plugins. Then exit from the browser and restart it.<br>
<h3>Extensions</h3>There are many "addons" for SeaMonkey, that can
greatly enhance the user experience. Mostly these are available as a
single file with ".xpi" on the end of the filename. Some websites allow
you to insall them simply by clicking on the filename link, or you can
right-click and download the .xpi file -- once downloaded, if you
choose "File -&gt; Open" in the menu and open the .xpi file, SeaMonkey
will offer to install it.<br>
<br>
You can find many addons for SeaMonkey here:<br>
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/seamonkey/">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/seamonkey/</a> <br>
Some Firefox addons are not compatible with SeaMonkey, but this site has modified some to work in SeaMonkey:<br>
<a href="http://xsidebar.mozdev.org/modifiedmisc.html">http://xsidebar.mozdev.org/modifiedmisc.html</a> <br>
<br>
Note, your Puppy live-CD build may already have some installed addons.
There's no menu entry that tells you what addons are installed, however
there is a file that does: look for /usr/lib/seamonkey/install.log --
if it doesn't exist then you don't have any addons, if it does, open it
in a text editor to find out what is installed.<br>
IMPORTANT: 'install.log' may not list all installed addons. Check the
announcement/release-notes of your version of Puppy for complete list
of addons provided.<br>
<br>
Nor does SeaMonkey have a menu entry for uninstalling addons. However, it can be done manually -- to be documented.<br>
<h2>Video and audio codecs</h2>
XINE is the multimedia library used in Puppy and Gxine is the GUI
player. Gxine also has a browser plugin, that works with SeaMonkey,
Firefox and Opera.<br>
<br>
Note, you will find the Gxine plugin at /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins.
SeaMonkey, Firefox and Opera are able to find it at that location.<br>
<br>
Gxine also has a bit of a problem playing full-screen, but there is an
easy solution. First, maximize the window (the middle icon at top-right
of the window), then choose 'View -&gt; Full-screen mode' from the menu.<br>
NOTE: You will likely find this problem is fixed in the most recent versions of Puppy.<br>
<br>
The XINE library in Puppy can play most video and audio files, however
if you encounter one that does not play, there is a PET package with
extra "codecs" (plugins to support more file formats).<br>
The best place to find out more about this is in the <a href="HOWTO-multimedia.htm">HOWTO: multimedia</a> page.<br>
