rpl (RePLace) - replace strings in multiple files
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>VERSION</H2>

1.4.0
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

rpl [-iwRspfdtx [-q|-v]] &lt;old_str&gt; &lt;new_str&gt; &lt;target_file(s)&gt;
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<I>rpl</I>

replaces old_str with new_str in all target files. It returns the number of strings replaced
or a system error code (non-zero) if there is an error.

Note that you should put strings in single quotes if they contain spaces. You must also escape all shell meta-characters. It's a good idea to put ALL strings in single quotes.

<I>rpl</I>

will attempt to maintain the owner, group and permissions of your original files. For safety,
<I>rpl</I>

creates a temporary file and makes changes to that file. It then moves the temporary file over the original file.
<I>rpl</I>

sets the owner, group, and permissions of the new file to match those of the original file.
In some circumstances
<I>rpl</I>

will not be able to do this (such as when a file is owned by the superuser but you have group write permission).
In these cases
<I>rpl</I>

will warn you that the owner/group or permissions cannot be set and that file will be skipped, unless you use the force (-f) option. Note that the use of temp files in predictable, world-writeable locations could lead to symlink attacks. Ideally you should set the $TMPDIR environment variable to a private directory readable and writeable only by you. This is especially important if running
<I>rpl</I>

as root. You have been warned!

Normally,
<I>rpl</I>

will change the modification time of all files it processes like any other program. However, you may instruct
<I>rpl</I>

to keep the original modification times using the -d (Don't alter mod-times) option.

You can specify file suffixes to be searched using the -x option. Any files that do not match the specified suffixes will not be searched or modified. The -x option may be used more than once to tell 
<I>rpl</I>

to search files with varying suffixes. For instance, say you wanted to search all of your &quot;.html&quot;, &quot;.htm&quot;, and &quot;.php&quot; files you would add 

&quot; -x'.html' -x'.htm' -x'.php' &quot;

to your command line. 
<I>rpl</I>

would then skip any files that did not end with these suffixes. This is mainly useful when doing recursive searching (-R option).

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-i</B>

<DD>
Ignore case of old_str
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<I>rpl</I>

will match the old_str in the searched file regardless of the case. The case of new_str will not be altered.
</DL>

<DT><B>-w</B>

<DD>
Whole words (old_str bounded by white space in file)
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<I>rpl</I>

will only match old_str if it is bounded by the start of a line, a space, a tab, or the end of a line.
</DL>

<DT><B>-q</B>

<DD>
Quiet mode (no output at all)
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Good for shell scripts, etc.
</DL>

<DT><B>-v</B>

<DD>
Verbose mode (lots of output)
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<I>rpl</I>

will list the name of each file and directory, and the line numbers that contain matches.
</DL>

<DT><B>-R</B>

<DD>
Search directories recursively
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<I>rpl</I>

will scan every file and every directory recursively. Without this option directories will be skipped.
</DL>

<DT><B>-x</B>

<DD>
Specify file suffixes to search. (e.g. &quot;.html&quot;, &quot;.c&quot;, etc.) May be used multiple times. See above for details.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
</DL>

<DT><B>-p</B>

<DD>
Prompt for each file
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<I>rpl</I>

will prompt you before scanning each file. If you respond 'N' or 'n'
<I>rpl</I>

will skip that file and move on to the next file. The default action if you press enter is to process the file.
</DL>

<DT><B>-s</B>

<DD>
Simulation mode
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<I>rpl</I>

will scan all of the files and list the names of files that it would modify if a replace operation was executed. If you turn on the verbose (-v) option as well
<I>rpl</I>

will list the line numbers where the string is matched.
</DL>

<DT><B>-e</B>

<DD>
Honor Escapes
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<I>rpl</I>

will honor escape sequences in old_string and new_string.  Standard escapes such as &quot;	&quot; (tab), &quot; (newline), &quot;&quot; (carriage return) are processed, as well as any octal or hexidecimal ASCII codes. Octal ASCII codes start with a '' and are comprised of three digits [0-7] (e.g. '&nbsp;15'). Hexidecimal ASCII codes start with '&nbsp;x' followed by two characters [0-f] (e.g. '&nbsp;x0d'). The 'x' and the [a-f] may be upper or lowercase. When you use this switch you must escape all backslash ('') characters with another backslash (e.g. '\').
</DL>

<DT><B>-f</B>

<DD>
Force mode
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<I>rpl</I>

will overwrite files even if the owner, group, or permissions of the new file will not match the original. Obviously,
<I>rpl</I>

cannot overwrite files if the user does not have write permission.
</DL>

<DT><B>-d</B>

<DD>
Don't change modification times
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<I>rpl</I>

will process files, but keep their original modification times.
</DL>

<DT><B>-t</B>

<DD>
Use $TMPDIR for temporary files
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Causes
<I>rpl</I>

to write temporary files to the directory specified by the environment variable $TMPDIR instead of writing the temp files to the original file dir. (See note above about symlink attacks and temp files.)
