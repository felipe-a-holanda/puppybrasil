<h1><img style="width: 96px; height: 96px;" src="puppylogo96.png" alt=""> HOWTO: Write
programs</h1>

<p>Puppy is a tiny distribution, but there is a wide choice of
programming languages. The default live-CD is not setup for compiling C
or C++
programs, however there is an add-on file named 'devx_xxx.sfs'
(where
'xxx' is the Puppy version number, for example
'430' for version 4.3) that turns
Puppy into a complete C/C++ compiling environment (Vala/Genie compiler
also). The 'devx' file also provides Python. Without devx_430.sfs, the live-CD already has
Ash/Bash and Perl scripting languages. This page has a summary of
the programming options in Puppy...<br>
</p><h3>Ash/Bash scripts</h3>

<p>A language that is all ready for action in Puppy is <i>command-shell
scripting</i>. Unix and Linux shell command-scripting has been around for
ages and is going to be around for a long time to come. What I mean by the
"command shell" is the user interface that you use when at the commandline.
When you are running X, the commandline will be in a  terminal window, but
you can also exit from X and be back at a commandline.<br>
</p>
The actual program that is running and doing the interacting with you is
known as the command-shell, and for Linux it is usually what is known as the
<i>Bash</i> shell. In Puppy, you have a choice of two shells, Bash or <span style="font-style: italic;">Ash</span>.<br>
Note that when a terminal window is opened in X, Bash is running. If
you exit from X to the commandline, Ash is running. You can explicitly
choose either Bash or Ash in a script by placing "#!/bin/bash" or
"#!/bin/sh" (or "#!/bin/ash") on the first line.<br>
<br>
A shell script is an executable program, except that it is a text file and
does not have to be compiled. Shell scripts can be very sophisticated, and
there are lots of them in Puppy.<br>
<br>
This page is not a tutorial on how to program with Ash/Bash scripts --there
are  plenty of books on the subject and also on the Internet. There are a
couple  of Bash scripting HOWTOs to be found here:<br>
<br>
"Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide": <a href="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/index.html">http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/index.html</a>
<br>
"Bash Programming - Introduction HOWTO": <a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html">http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html</a>
<br>
<br>
To write a Ash/Bash script, all you need is a text editor, and Puppy has two
console editors, <i>e3</i> and <i>MP</i>, and two GUI editors, <i>Geany</i>
and <i>NicoEdit</i>. Geany, NicoEdit and MP have
color syntax highlighting for Bash/Ash scripts.<br>
<br>
Have fun, write a script for Puppy!  <br>
<br>Here is an overview of tools to aid with scripting, with links to online docs:<br>

      <td valign="top">This is yet another alternative to xmessage
        and Xdialog. Gtkdialog is a GTK2 application and reads an XML file
        that describes the dialog format and user interaction, allowing
        incredible sophisticated GUIs. I think that gtkdialog is the pick of the bunch!<br>
Note that Puppy currently has two versions of gtkdialog, named
gtkdialog2 and gtkdialog3 -- it is preferred that you use the latter as
this will eventually be the only one in Puppy -- in other words, always
execute the binary "gtkdialog3".<br>
Note, the <a href="gtkdialog3/gtkdialog.txt">user manual</a> for gtkdialog3 is rudimentary, but the 'devx'
module has many example programs at /usr/share/doc/gtkdialog3/examples.<br>
Forum member 'zigbert' has a nice tutorial with tips on how to use gtkdialog: <a href="http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=38608">GtkDialog tips</a>.<br>

Here are some scripts used in Puppy:<br>
/usr/sbin/<a href="file:///usr/sbin/pmount">pmount</a> <br>
/usr/sbin/<a href="file:///usr/sbin/timezone-set">timezone-set</a> <br>
<h3><span class="postbody">C/C++ programming</span></h3>
<h3><span class="postbody"></span></h3>
<span class="postbody">All of the tools for compiling C/C++ applications are to be found in an add-on file named <span style="font-style: italic;">devx_xxx.sfs</span>. This is what we call an <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">SFS</span> file, and you can read an overview of these online in this page: <a href="http://puppylinux.com/development/package-management.htm">http://puppylinux.com/development/package-management.htm</a> <br>
<br>
To use this file is very simple. Download it from the Internet (it is
about 90MB) and save to /mnt/home (the same place as the "pupsave.2fs" file).
<br>
<br></span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span class="postbody">
Or, if you have installed Puppy to hard drive with what we call a
"full" installation (Puppy occupying his own partition, no
ramdisk), then download the devx_xxx.sfs file ...then some manual steps are required, see here: <a href="http://www.puppylinux.com/hard-puppy.htm">http://www.puppylinux.com/hard-puppy.htm</a>.</span><br>
<span class="postbody"></span></div>
<span class="postbody">
<br>
After downloading devx_xxx.sfs and placing it in the right place, reboot Puppy, and that's it, you're ready to go.<br>
All of the normal compiling tools work, such as "configure" and "make".<br>
<br>
Note, it is necessary that the PC have either a Linux swap partition and/or a <span style="font-style: italic;">lot</span>
of RAM. C/C++ compiling needs a lot of temporary space.<br>
<br>
It is also recommended that you place the source package in a mounted
Linux partition, not in /root. This is in the case of running from a
live-CD or a frugal install, in which '/' is actually a layered
filesystem. A layered filesystem sometimes causes problems with
compiling, so it is recommended to mount a hard drive partition for the
purpose -- a Linux partition, <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> a DOS/Windows partition!<br>
<br>
If you compile a package and would like to make it available for others
to use, it is very easy to create a PET package -- read this: <a href="http://www.puppylinux.com/development/createpet.htm">http://www.puppylinux.com/development/createpet.htm </a><br>
<br>
If you want to write GTK applications, the 'devx' file also has
'glade-3'. This is a visual GUI-builder. Find out more about Glade
here: <a href="http://glade.gnome.org/">http://glade.gnome.org/</a>
The 'glade-3' program generates an XML file, and Puppy has 'libglade',
a library that an application uses to read the XML file and generate
the GUI.<br>
<br>
Note, gtkdialog3 is also able to load a Glade XML file. See the
gtkdialog3 examples at /usr/share/doc/gtkdialog/examples, provided by
the 'devx' file. So, even a Bash script can utilise Glade.<br>
<br>

<h3><span class="postbody">Vala/Genie programming</span></h3>
<h3><span class="postbody"></span></h3>
<span class="postbody">This is the future. Vala and Genie are languages
in every respect superior to C/C++. Vala has a C#-like syntax, Genie
has a Python-like syntax. It is actually the same compiler, it just
accepts two alternative syntaxes.<br>
<br>
Vala/Genie is a true compiler environment and generates extremely
efficient executables. They are particularly nice for writing GTK
applications. I have placed the Vala/Genie compiler, with documentation
and the ValaIDE, in the 'devx' SFS file.<br>
<br>
Online documentation on Vala/Genie is here:<br>
<a href="http://puppylinux.com/genie/index.html">http://puppylinux.com/genie/index.html</a> <br>
<br>
The ValaIDE is an Integrated Development Environment, with a text
editor that has colour syntax highlghting for both Vala and Genie. If
the 'devx' SFS file is loaded, you will find an entry for ValaIDE in
the 'Utility' menu.<br>
<br>
Note that the NicoEdit text editor also has syntax highlighting for
Vala and Genie. The Geany text editor has syntax highlighting for Vala
but not Genie.<br>
<br>
Also if the 'devx' sfs file is loaded you will find the Vala Reference Manual at <a href="file:///usr/share/devhelp/books/vala/index.html">/usr/share/devhelp/books/vala/index.html</a>.<br>
<br>
We are standardising on Vala/Genie for future application development
in Puppy, particularly Genie due to its friendly syntax. You can find
some exciting new applications on the Puppy forum, that are gradually
finding their way into the official Puppy live-CD.<br>
<br>Nicholas's NicoEdit text editor is one example, a GTK application
written in
Genie. It doesn't stop there, Mark has written PuppyBrowser,
EmbeddedBookmarks and Pictureviewer in Genie, and I have even included
the source code in Puppy:<br>
<br>
/usr/local/PuppyBrowser<br>
/usr/local/EmbeddedBookmarks<br>
/usr/local/Pictureviewer<br>
