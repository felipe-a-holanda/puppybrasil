This program will tag and/or edit existing tags of various audio file
types. This gui depends on at least one of the following command line
taggers:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; metaflac: necessary for flac support (flac files get corrupted with other taggers)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vorbiscomment: supports the ogg format (so does mp3info &amp; id3tag)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AtomicParsley: supports the itunes tagging structure with m4a, m4b, m4p, m4v, &amp; mp4 files<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mp3info: version 1 tags &amp; supports many audio formats (not just mp3)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; id3tag, id3convert, id3info: version 1 tags that support many formats, also version 2 tags for mp3<br>
<br>
The gtkdialog (version 0.7.20 or possibly greater) program is also a dependancy.<br>
<br>
For some command line specific options please enter "pmetatagger --help" at the command line.<br>
<br>
You can choose to load a directory of a specific file type into the gui
or you can load a single file. The program will find the various
tagging programs you have installed and will check your file for a tag.
The information that is found will be displayed in the gui. You can
then edit or enter the information you want in the tag. For formats
other than flac there will be a combobox where you can select your
tagger. The existing tagger type will be displayed first but if you
want to change to a different tagger you can select it from the drop
down box (if multiple taggers are installed). If you click "DUMP-tag"
the tag information will be dumped to a file named (your input
file).ptag in the same directory as your file. This ptag file can be
read and edited with a regular text editor. You could then use this
ptag file as a tag for another file by clicking the button "Tag file
with an existing ptag". When you're done editing your tag or selecting
an existing ptag click the "Next" or "Ok" button to move onto the next
file or end the process if all file/s have been run thru the gui.<br>
<br>
For the AtomicParsley supported formats there are alot of tagging options so the gui is a bit more advanced for those filetypes.<br>
