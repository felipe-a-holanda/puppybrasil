    NAME

wvdial - PPP dialer with built-in intelligence.

 


    SYNOPSIS

*wvdial* /--help | --version | --chat | --config | option=value |
--no-syslog | section.../

 


    DESCRIPTION

*wvdial* is an intelligent PPP dialer, which means that it dials a modem
and starts PPP in order to connect to the Internet. It is something like
the *chat <http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+chat>*(8) program,
except that it uses heuristics to guess how to dial and log into your
server rather than forcing you to write a login script.

When *wvdial* starts, it first loads its configuration from
//etc/wvdial.conf/ and /~/.wvdialrc/ which contains basic information
about the modem port, speed, and init string, along with information
about your Internet Service Provider (ISP), such as the phone number,
your username, and your password.

Then it initializes your modem and dials the server and waits for a
connection (a CONNECT string from the modem). It understands and
responds to typical connection problems (like BUSY and NO DIALTONE).

Any time after connecting, *wvdial* will start PPP if it sees a PPP
sequence from the server. Otherwise, it tries to convince the server to
start PPP by doing the following:

 - responding to any login/password prompts it sees;
 - interpreting "choose one of the following"-style menus;
 - eventually, sending the word "ppp" (a common terminal server command).

    If all of this fails, *wvdial* just runs *pppd
    <http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+pppd>*(8) and hopes for the
    best. It will bring up the connection, and then wait patiently for
    you to drop the link by pressin CTRL-C.

     


        OPTIONS

    Several options are recognized by *wvdial*.

    /--chat/
        Run wvdial as a chat replacement from within pppd, instead of
        the more normal method of having wvdial negotiate the connection
        and then call pppd. 
    /--remotename/
        Override the Remote Name setting in the dialer configuration
        section of the configuration file. This is mainly useful when
        you dial to multiple systems with the same user name and
        password, and you don't want to use inheritance to override this
        setting (which is the recommended way to do it). 
    /--config /[/configfile/]
        Run wvdial with configfile as the configuration file (instead of
        /etc/wvdial.conf). This is mainly useful only if you want to
        have per-user configurations, or you want to avoid having
        dial-up information (usernames, passwords, calling card numbers,
        etc.) in a system wide configuration file. 
    /--no-syslog/
        Don't output debug information to the syslog daemon (only useful
        together with --chat). 
    /--help/
        Prints a short message describing how to use *wvdial* and exits. 
    /--version/
        Displays *wvdial*'s version number and exits. 

    *wvdial* is normally run without command line options, in which case
    it reads its configuration from the /[Dialer Defaults]/ section of
    //etc/wvdial.conf/. (The configuration file is described in more
    detail in wvdial.conf
    <http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+wvdial.conf>(5) manual page.)

    One or more sections of //etc/wvdial.conf/ may be specified on the
    command line. Settings in these sections will override settings in
    /[Dialer Defaults]/.

    For example, the command:
        *wvdial phone2* 

    will read default options from the /[Dialer Defaults]/ section, then
    override any or all of the options with those found in the /[Dialer
    phone2]/ section.

    If more than one section is specified, they are processed in the
    order they are given. Each section will override all the sections
    that came before it.

    For example, the command:
        *wvdial phone2 pulse shh* 

    will read default options from the /[Dialer Defaults]/ section, then
    override any or all of the options with those found in the /[Dialer
    phone2]/ section, followed by the /[Dialer pulse]/ section, and
    lastly the /[Dialer shh]/ section.

    Using this method, it is possible to easily configure *wvdial* to
    switch between different internet providers, modem init strings,
    account names, and so on without specifying the same configuration
    information over and over.

     


        BUGS

    "Intelligent" programs are frustrating when they don't work right.
    This version of *wvdial* has only minimal support for disabling or
    overriding its "intelligence", with the "Stupid Mode", "Login
    Prompt", and "Password Prompt" options. So, in general if you have a
    nice ISP, it will probably work, and if you have a weird ISP, it
    might not.

    Still, it's not much good if it doesn't work for you, right? Don't
    be fooled by the fact that *wvdial* finally made it to version 1.00;
    it could well contain many bugs and misfeatures. Let us know if you
    have problems by sending e-mail to *<wvdial@nit.ca
    <mailto:wvdial@nit.ca>>*.

    Also, there is now a mailing list for discussion about *wvdial*. If
    you are having problems, or have anything else to say, send e-mail
    to *<wvdial-list@lists.nit.ca <mailto:wvdial-list@lists.nit.ca>>*.

    You may encounter some error messages if you don't have write access
    to */etc/ppp/pap-secrets* and */etc/ppp/chap-secrets*.
    Unfortunately, there's really no nice way around this yet.  


        FILES

    /etc/wvdial.conf
        Configuration file which contains modem, dialing, and login
        information. See 
    /dev/ttyS*
        Serial port devices. 
    /etc/ppp/peers/wvdial
        Required for correct authentication in pppd version 2.3.0 or newer. 
    /etc/ppp/{pap,chap}-secrets
        Contains a list of usernames and passwords used by pppd for
        authentication. *wvdial* maintains this list automatically.
