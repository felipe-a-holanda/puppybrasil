    NAME

wvdialconf - build a configuration file for *wvdial
<http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+wvdial>*(1)

 


    SYNOPSIS

*wvdialconf* //etc/wvdial.conf/

 


    DESCRIPTION

*wvdialconf* detects your modem, its maximum baud rate, and a good
initialization string and generates or updates the *wvdial
<http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+wvdial>*(1) configuration file
based on this information.

*wvdialconf* is completely non-interactive. You still need to edit
//etc/wvdial.conf/ to specify the phone number, login name, and password
of your internet account in order for *wvdial
<http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+wvdial>*(1) to work.

It is safe to run *wvdialconf* if a configuration file already exists.
In that case, only the /Modem/, /Baud/, /Init/, and /Init2/ options are
changed in the /[Dialer Defaults]/ section, and only if autodetection is
successful.

 


    BUGS

We're willing to entertain the possibility. Let us know if you have any
problems by sending an e-mail to *<wvdial@nit.ca <mailto:wvdial@nit.ca>>*.

Also, there is now a mailing list for discussion about *wvdial*. If you
are having problems, or have anything else to say, send e-mail to
*<wvdial-list@lists.nit.ca <mailto:wvdial-list@lists.nit.ca>>*.

 


    DIAGNOSTICS

An exit status of 0 means that a modem was detected and the
configuration file was updated successfully.

Any other value means that something went wrong and the configuration
file was unchanged.
