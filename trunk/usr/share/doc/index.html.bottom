Note that although Lucid Puppy has Busybox, which is a very small toolkit of
utility applications, in some cases they do not have the required
functionality and are replaced by the full versions. These replacements
include: modprobe, cat, cp, df, gzip, gunzip, losetup, ls, mkdir, mv, rm,
sed, sort, tar, wget, date, find, grep, fgrep and egrep.
</p>
<br>
<p>Note that Lucid Puppy applications are open source and under various GPL licences, however there are a few exceptions. <br>
</p>
<p>Planmaker Free
Edition (spreadsheet editor) and Textmaker Free Edition (wordprocessor) are PET packages. The licence
document is included in the packages.
We need to be able to open
and edit Excel-format spreadsheets, which Planmaker does admirably, and
the
Free Edition is just that, free, no embedded adverts, no usage
restrictions (except for a limited maximum size that can be edited).
I would like to do the right thing by the developer, Softmaker
Software,
though, and recommend that you consider the full edition if Planmaker
is to
be used for serious commercial purposes.</p>
<p>
Some releases of Puppy have the Opera web browser, which is closed source but free.<br>
