<h1>CUPS Web Interface Help</h1>
<br>
Your default browser should have opened (or will open after 3-30
seconds) with the CUPS web interface. Here you can add and configure
your printer.<br>
<br>
IMPORTANT: If asked for a username and password, enter 'root' and 'woofwoof'.<br>
<br>
Click on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Manage Printers</span>, then <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add Printer</span>. Enter a name for your printer, e.g. <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">HL1030</span>. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Location</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description</span> fields can be left blank. Click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Continue</span>.<br>
<br>
The steps after that should be straightforward, and hopefully you will
find a printer driver that works for you. Finally you should see a
message: <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Printer HL1030 has been added successfully</span>.<br>
<br>
Click on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Printers</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Configure Printer</span> to change <span style="font-weight: bold;">Page Size</span> (if
needed) and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Resolution</span> (600 DPI is good for most jobs). Click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Continue</span>, then <span style="font-weight: bold;">Printers</span> again. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Printer State</span> should be <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">idle, accepting jobs</span>.<br>

<br>

Finally, click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Print Test Page</span> to see if your printer works.<br>
<h2>Printer drivers</h2>
Puppy has the Gutenprint package, which has a lot of printer drivers.
However, if your printer is not among them, you may be able to find a
driver online. For example, I needed a driver for my Brother HL2040
laser printer -- it was located, and I have put it permanently into
Puppy -- look at /usr/share/cups/model/<a style="font-weight: bold;" href="file:///usr/share/cups/model/Brother-HL-2040-hl1250.ppd">Brother-HL-2040-hl1250.ppd</a> if you are curious what a printer driver file looks like. Note that the file has extension <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">.ppd</span>.<br>
<br>
Two manufacturers with excellent support for Linux are <span style="font-weight: bold;">Brother</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hewlett Packard</span>,
and Puppy enthusiasts have created PET packages of these. <br>
<br>
At the time of writing, the Hewlett Packard <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hpliplite</span> package is available in the official Puppy4 PET package repository (package created by MU). Just start the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Puppy Package Manager</span>
(see Setup category in menu) and do a search for "hpliplite". This
package supports a very wide range of Hewlett Packard printers and
scanners. <br>
<br>
