 <text><label>Welcome! This little program will create a boot floppy disk, for booting puppy. WakePup2 is a floppy disk that will search for Puppy on USB, CD/DVD or hard drive and if found will boot puppy. A limitation is that Puppy must be installed in a FAT or NTFS partition on the USB or hard drive.</label></text>
 <text><label>Why use WakePup2? The most common reason is you have used the Puppy Universal Installer (see 'Setup' menu) to install Puppy to a USB Flash 'key' drive, but the PC refuses to boot from it. Or, you have a PC that has a CD drive but refuses to boot from it. This is a solution for such cantankerous PCs, but of course is not applicable if you have a modern sans-floppy-drive PC.</label></text>
 <text><label>Note, if you need to boot Puppy installed in a Linux partition (ext2, ext3, reiserfs, or minix), it is possible to create a GRUB boot floppy and this can be done when the 'Puppy Universal Installer' (in 'Setup' menu) is executed, or by selecting 'GRUB bootloader config' from the 'Control Panel' menu.</label></text>
 <text><label>\"  \"</label></text>
 <text><label>WAKEPUP2 CURRENTLY NOT AVAILABLE</label></text>
 <text><label>You need to first install the WakePup2 PET package -- just click the 'install' button on the desktop (Internet access required). Note, the WakePup developer guys have come up with different WakePup's that may perform better on certain hardware -- see the main Puppy Forum</label></text>
 <text><label>CLICK 'Cancel' button for now, then install WakePup2...</label></text>
