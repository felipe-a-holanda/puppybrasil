#  <text><label>If you wish, you can use Mark Ulrichs DotPup Downloader, which is a one-stop find and install application. The DotPup Downloader does not show all the information that may be present on a webpage containing DotPups, nor does it list all DotPups, but it is still very nice.</label></text>

#  <text><label>The PETget package manager can install and uninstall PET packages, and also uninstall registered DotPups.</label></text>

# <frame Further information>
#  <text><label>It is recommended that you look through the official PETs for what you want first, for maximum compatibility. Then look at unofficial PETs. There is also an older 'DotPup' package system and you can recognise these by the '.pup' extension on the filename. For the sake of consistency and compatibility DotPup packages are discouraged, but if you want to install them, please first install the 'dotpuphandler' PET package, which enables DotPups to be installed by clicking on them in ROX-Filer. Most DotPups register with PETget, the PET package manager, so can be uninstalled by PETget, so there is some integration. There are lots of DotPups out there for historical reasons -- other than that, PET is preferable.</label></text>

 <text><label>The word 'install' can mean two different things, either to install additional applications in the current Puppy, or to install Puppy to some other media. Take your pick!</label></text>
 
 <frame Install Puppy>
  <text><label>Puppy can be installed to just about anything, including internal hard drive, USB drive, and Zip/LS120 diskette. If for example you are now running Puppy from live-CD and fancy booting Puppy off a USB Flash drive, this is the right place. There are two tools, the Puppy Universal Installer, and BootFlash -- the first is recommended, BootFlash is your second choice, a specialised tool if you cannot get the computer to boot from a USB drive.</label></text>

 <frame Install applications>
  <text><label>The Puppy Package Manager is a tool for installing and uninstalling packages (applications). There are online repositories of ${DISTRO_BINARY_COMPAT} and Puppy packages -- the latter are known as PET packages and are identified by '.pet' on the end of their filename. Note that apart from the official ${DISTRO_BINARY_COMPAT} and PET repositories, Puppy enthusiasts have created many PETs at other locations, and all you need to do is download one and click on it to install it.</label></text>
