The list of supported drivers is in text file /etc/sane.d/dll.conf
When Xsane starts, your scanner (if it is connected and turned on)
should be autodetected. However, some entries in 'dll.conf' are
commented-out. Here is the list of SANE drivers that are commented
-out in file 'dll.conf':

$COMMOUT

If your scanner is one of these, then Xsane will not auto-detect it.
-- in that case, click 'QUIT' button and open 'dll.conf' in a text
   editor and uncomment the appropriate entry.
   
Xsane may be a bit 'insane' when detecting a SCSI scanner. There are
various things that you may have to do:
1. Run 'sane-find-scanner' in a terminal window.
2. Make sure 'sg' module is loaded.
3. Specify the device on the commandline, ex: # xsane microtek2:/dev/sg3
4. or maybe a symbolic link, ex: # ln -s /dev/sg3 /dev/scanner

To continue and run Xsane, answer this question:
Do you have a parallel-port, USB or SCSI scanner?"
